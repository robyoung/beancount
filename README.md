# Zed Beancount

This extension adds support for the [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) language.

## Setup

By default this extension just provides syntax highlighting for `.beancount` and `.bean` files, but also optional support for [`beancount-language-server`](https://github.com/polarmutex/beancount-language-server) as well.

To use that you will need `beancount` and `beancount-language-server` available in your path.  For example, on mac:

```
brew install beancount beancount-language-server
```
